# gretl_scripts
some useful (at least for me) scripts for gretl. I use gretl for simulation analysis, with an emphasis of descriptive analysis and visualisation.

###Update

- I changed to put everything into a (proper?) function package
- Still early status, but it is working.
- load "_test.inp" within the folder "special_plot" for details and testing.

\# removed all the older stuff.
