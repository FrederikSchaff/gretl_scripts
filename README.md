# gretl_scripts
some useful (at least for me) scripts for gretl. I use gretl for simulation analysis, with an emphasis of descriptive analysis and visualisation.

#### Plot_scripts
A set of scripts for plotting (via gnuplot).
- colours.inp: some helpers for colour selection
- helpers.inp: some general helper scripts
- cross_sect_plots.inp: some scripts for useful cross-section data visualisation (e.g. simulation sensitvity output)

**Status:**
- just getting started...
- currently the jitter plot is explored

*Suggestions or help is welcome. Feel free to use/change/etc. the code snippets!*
